        <h3>Blue Angels Cherenkov</h3>
        <p><strong>Bio:</strong> The team was created in the start of Season 2 with the main sponsor being Cherenkov Vodka. Their season would finish with them having a driver in second in the drivers standing and winning the Class A class with a driver finishing the season second on the teams championship. Blue Angels was a German team mostly driving lower-class cars being one of the best in that class, but after Season 2 they decided to unite with Cherenkov making them the <strong>Blue Angels Cherenkov</strong>.</p>
